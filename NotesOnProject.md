# CalculatingProteinMass
Created to solve the Rosalind Problem(http://rosalind.info/problems/prtm/) Python 3.4
I used Python Dictonary for checking the mass of various proteins as I thought this was the best/easiest solution, with a pretty quick loop up time.The time complexity of dict search in python is around O(n) worst case as its a hash map which is pretty important when working with a large scale data set!
